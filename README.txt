This is my attempt to simulate the popular game 'monopoly' or 'business'.
The code is entirely written in C++.
I do not have any knowldge of Data Sturcutures and Algorithms, so the code is rather rudimentary.
Would absolutely love to collaborate with any interested person.

Run the game.cpp file to get the simulation details.
